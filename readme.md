# Configuration
This project is powered by ASP.NET Core 3.1. We recommend you install Visual Studio 2019 as the project was developed using this IDE. However, you can also install the [.NET Core 3.1 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/3.1) instead if you do not wish to use Visual Studio. 

Make sure to set your API key in the appsetting.json file, this is needed to authenticate with mattero.

# Debuging
If are using Visual Studio 2019, simply run the project using the built-in debugging tools.

If you wish to use CLI, you can run the project by using this command in the root of the repository ``dotnet run --project Integration.Sample``.

Using either of these methods will launch the website with the following URLs https://localhost:5001, and http://localhost:5000.
